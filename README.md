# Telecom-Churn
This project is aimed to build a classifier model to predict whether a customer will soon stop doing business with SyriaTel, a communications company.​

The main interest of the company is in reducing how much money is lost because of customers who don't stick around very long.​

The project contains the Business Problem, Data Understanding, Predictive Modeling, Model Evaluation, and Recommendations.​

## Description
The business problem involves predicting customer churn for SyriaTel, a telecom company, to proactively identify which customers are likely to leave the service. This prediction allows Syriatel to implement targeted retention strategies, thereby reducing customer attrition and enhancing profitability. The primary stakeholders in this project include the executive team, who are interested in overall financial performance; the marketing department, which will develop and execute retention campaigns; the customer service team, tasked with addressing customer issues preemptively; and the data analytics team, responsible for developing and maintaining the predictive model. Additionally, customers themselves are indirect stakeholders, as improved retention efforts can lead to better service and satisfaction.

The dataset,sourced from Kaggle, provides comprehensive information on customer behavior and service usage. Key columns include demographic and account details ('state', 'account length', 'area code', 'phone number'), service plans ('international plan', 'voice mail plan'), usage metrics ('number vmail messages', 'total day minutes', 'total eve minutes', 'total night minutes', 'total intl minutes'), corresponding charges, and interaction frequency ('total day calls', 'total eve calls', 'total night calls', 'total intl calls', 'customer service calls'). The target variable 'churn' indicates whether a customer has discontinued the service. This dataset offers a rich foundation for understanding patterns and factors influencing customer churn, facilitating the development of a predictive model to address the business problem.
